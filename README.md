This program is an anomaly detector for any given timeSeries set of data.

Anomaly detection is a process that will identify any deviated data points, events, and/or observations from a given datasetâ€™s normal behavior.
If found, anomalous data can potentialy indicate critical incidents for a broad spectrum of problems, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for example a traded stock that now has a buy or sell signal based on specific, pre calculated signals.

Time series data is data composed of a sequence of values (in the form of 2D points) over time.
Normally, and in my implementation, each point is given as a pair of two items:
X = the moment in time the metric was measured
Y = the value of that metric at that point in time.
A time series gives a viewer a sense of how that value has behaved over time. 

Please feel free to explore and test my code.
Enjoy, and thanks for reading!
